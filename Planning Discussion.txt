TOP DOWN RACING GAME
====================

Componenets we WANT to implement/Required:
---------------------------------
	movement
		- Top down
		
	opponents (REQUIRED)
		- AI
			start stupid make smart
		
	weapons/Power Ups (REQUIRED)
		- heat seeking missle (red shell)
			path finding
		- blue shell (hits player in first)
			can hit others
		- Turbo
		
	hazards (REQUIRED)
		- potholes
		- items left on ground from other players

	multiple levels (REQUIRED)
		- scrolling map/on same screen
		- track that bridges other parts
			- bridges
		- one long race
		- 2 lap races
		- 3 lap races
		- one super short race with multiple laps
	
	Race Conditions (REQUIRED)
		- When the player finishes the race ends, all AI are then ranked where they would have finished when the player finishes
		
	cars/Customization (REQUIRED)
		- speed
		- acceleration
		- if you get hit, spin out, re acceletate
		- Up-Grade you car
			- Better engine (Faster acceleration + higher top speed)
			- Better tires (Faster acceleration)
			- Make car more aerodynamic (helps acceleration)
			- Gear ratio improvement (increase top speed)
		
	HUD (REQUIRED)
		- Shows current place out of the total number of racers
		- Shows the current weapon you have on you/Current power up you have or are using
		- Shows the current lap/total number of laps
		- Timer? How long youve been racing/or time per lap.	

	music/sound effects
		- 
		
	Race Start animations
		- Stick figure starter
			think bikini starter waving flag but a stick man

Technical Requirements
----------------------
• OpenGL graphics, C++
• Physics-based movement, collisions
• Movement through transformations
	• Hierarchical transformation used in some way
• Particle system effect (explosion, sparks, …)
• Finite state machine for AI; multiple game states (e.g., store)
• Multiple game entities with different behaviours
• Multiple terrain types with different effects
• Gameworld larger than the screen

Suggestions:
------------
Ongoing game: several levels with persistent elements
	• E.g., earn money by placing high, spend on
	• E.g., gain skill points and train up your driver

• Various resources
	• Fuel, ammunition, wear & tear on the car

• Various hazards
	• oil slick, ice, spikes, pedestrians, monsters

• Music


Possible Componenets:
---------------------
	
	Drifting
	
	Drafting
		distance detection
		timer
		after x amount of time at certain distance
			acceleration up for 5ish seconds
			degrade over time after leaving sweet spot behind other car
	
	Directional aiming/steering
		- keyboard/mouse
			yet to be decided
			
	
		
	differnt kinds of cars
		- weight classes
		- stat changes

	List of placements (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)
		- on side of screen
		
	If you finish first you start next in first
		start in position you finished last race
	

Definetly not:
--------------
	grand prix
	multiplayer
	customizing cars
	3D
